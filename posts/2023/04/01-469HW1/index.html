            <h3>CENG469 - Homework 1 - Blog Post</h3>
            <p>Hello everybody! Welcome to my post about the first homework of CENG469 (Graphics II).</p>
            <p>First of all, I need to say that my homework is not completely done. Well, it is sort of done but lighting is very bad right now. I haven't been able to find the reason for this, but even though Bezier equations work more-or-less correctly, either the normal calculation or light calculation does not work. Now, it looks like this (from <code>input3.txt</code>):</p>

            <p>The bright part is not caused by specular shading and I couldn't understand whether it works or not. However, I definitely know that diffuse shading does not work. As I said before, I don't know the reason, yet alone the solution.</p>
            <p>Even though I wasn't able to do lighting properly, I think that the rendering is not done badly. I used a <em>single</em> draw call each frame no matter what tesellation or surface count is.</p>
            <p>How I achieve is simple: just allocating enough vertices and faces for 80x80 sampling for every surface defined in the input. The number of surfaces does not change throughout the program's lifetime and sampling number cannot exceed 80, so I can just allocate once. This makes it possible to render a single instance of vertices and calculate everything else except lighting in the vertex shader. The reason why I did not use multi-instance rendering is that, well, I learnt its existance pretty late. But it would probably be still worse, since GPU must allocate enough vertices for all the instances, but in my case I just calculate every vertex; hence, there is no need for GPU to manage memory after the first allocation. I did not test instanced rendering, but intuition says this. Still, even on WSL, the program is pretty responsive and my computer's GPU is actually weaker than GPUs of Inek machines (mine is Intel Xe, Ineks use Quadro P2200), so I don't think responsiveness would be a problem. As I will come to Ankara much later than the due-date-with-late-days of the homework, I cannot properly test the visuals of the program.</p>
            <p>The thing that helped the most was <code>gl_VertexIndex</code>. As stated in the homework PDF, it gives the index of the vertex currently in process, and this is <em>exactly</em> what I need. Actually I used this index as a 4D index. Both the answers of "Which surface is this vertex in?" and "Where must this vertex be sampled?" resides in this index. As the count of samples belonging to a certain surface is constant, namely <code>80*80</code>, every <em>n</em>th vertex of consecutive surface is <code>80*80</code> vertices apart from each other. So that when I do <code>gl_VertexIndex/(80*80)</code>, I would get the index of the surface currently in use. As surfaces are just the grid of surfaces enumerated, I needed to divide this result with another number to divide it to two numbers: in which row the surface is and in which column the surface is. When I do a similar division to <code>gl_VertexIndex%(80*80)</code> but with current sample number, I would get where the sample should be gotten. Using this, I first get the surface and then query it using the sample coordinate I got from modulo. If the sample coordinates (which are defined as in <em>inside</em> the surface and both are smaller than 80) exceed the current sample number, then I render them at (0,0). As this creates triangles with every corner being at (0,0), this effectively discards samples exceeding the sample count.</p>
            <p>Implementing the surface equation was pretty easy. However, I did not use Bernstein polynomials. I actually used the matrix formula of <em>Qz(s,t)</em> in the slides. This gave me probably correct (at least correct looking) results. However, its mathematical derivative gave me wrong answer, probably. As I said, there is some lighting problem and it's totally possible that it is caused by normal calculation, which I do by just cross producting the tangent vectors. I also did this using querying <em>epsilon</em>-far points in the curve and calculating tangents (basically taking numerical derivative), but it's less correct compared to mathematical derivative.</p>
            <p>Implementing parser was very easy, probably the easiest part in the homework, and I take OpenGL rendering code from CENG477 HW3, since it is good enough and I did not want to dive into low-level OpenGL code when I can just re-use the code I wrote before.</p>
            <p>As actual sample count does not depend on sample count, there should not be any observable performance difference with different sample count parameters.</p>
            <p>The method I used to create samples creates problem in machines other than mine. I don't know the exact reason, and I cannot do anything since as I said before I won't be in Ankara before the deadline so that I can only test on my own machine, yet the shapes are still more-or-less true. However, the program should probably have an epilepsy warning before opening it.</p>
            <p>Speaking of epilepsy, in development, I once forgot to set <code>gl_Position</code> for vertices exceeding the sample count. And this created random (for some reason) all green triangles. As the positions are unitialized memory in the VRAM of GPU, the triangles' positions just randomly changed between frames and the changes were extreme. This resulted in epilepsy-triggering visuals like this:</p>

            <figcaption>Video 1: Unitialized Memory</figcaption>
            <p>Even though I do not have epilepsy, my head still hurted after recording the video.</p>
            <p>Here is my test for multiple surfaces. Note that I used <code>z=x^2 + y^2</code> equation to get vertical values in this, the next and the previous tests. The colors also depend on the row and column position of the surface. I call this image "Halay Çeken Kareler"</p>

            <p>Here is what I call "Hills of Squareds", previous image with bigger <code>coordMultiplier</code> and a slightly different angle, resembling some generic Synthwave background image:</p>
